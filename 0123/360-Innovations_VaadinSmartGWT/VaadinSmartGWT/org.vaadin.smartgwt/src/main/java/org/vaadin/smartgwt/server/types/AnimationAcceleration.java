/**
 * Acceleration effect for animations. Can either be a ratio function or a string.&#010 Ratio functions take a value between 0 and 1 which represents how much
 * of the &#010 animation's duration has elapsed, and return another value between 0 and 1 indicating&#010 how close the animation is to completion. For a
 * completely linear animation, the &#010 function would return the value it was passed. This allows you to bias animations to&#010 [for example] speed up
 * toward the end of the animation.<br>
 * &#010 The following strings are also supported for common ratio bias effects:&#010
 * <ul>
 * &#010
 * <li>"smoothStart" - animation will speed up as time elapses&#010
 * <li>"smoothEnd" - animation will slow down as time elapses&#010
 * <li>"smoothStartEnd" - animation will speed up in the middle&#010
 * <li>"none" - no bias
 * </ul>
